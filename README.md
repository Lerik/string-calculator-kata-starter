# Welcome to the Kata Starter

This starter project has a basic structure and tooling for a quick TDD kata. It can be used in many settings, but was designed to be run inside of a [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io) workspace. To run this in a workspace, simply create a new workspace using the url of the repo and specifying a Node.js project. You can invite one or many developers to collaborate on the same code workspace for distributed pair programming.

## Getting Started...

Before you start coding, be sure to install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run the specs, simply run gulp:

```
npm run specs
```
